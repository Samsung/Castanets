This README describes how to use ia, the Instant Apps CLI tool.
This tool allows you to launch your instant apps in development mode,
and to check them for validation errors before publishing.

Prerequisites
=============
This Instant Apps CLI requires the Java Runtime Environment version 1.8
or greater ("Java 8"). Compatible JREs can be found at the following websites:

Oracle:     https://www.java.com/
OpenJDK:    http://openjdk.java.net/

Java also needs to be listed in the system PATH. Check the documentation for
your version of the JRE on how to do this.

Setup
=====
All files in the distribution must be kept together for the CLI to work.

MacOS and Linux
---------------
And add the "ia" file to your PATH. In Bash:
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:<full path of ia>"' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

Windows
-------
Add "ia.bat" to your PATH:
    setx PATH "%PATH%;<full path of ia.bat>"

Usage
=====
The ia program has a built-in help describing the available commands and
options. You can view it by running "ia help" from the command line.

Exit Codes
==========
The exit code of the ia command indicates whether it completed successfully.
The following codes are defined:

0   Success
1   General runtime error
2   Invalid command line or argument
3   "ia check" completed, but one or more errors were found with the app
