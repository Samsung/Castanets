FAIL Different heights assert_approx_equals: height0 expected 25 +/- 1 but got -5
FAIL Different depths assert_approx_equals: height0 expected 150 +/- 1 but got -5
FAIL Various combinations of height, depth and width. assert_approx_equals: width0 expected 25 +/- 1 but got 100
PASS Preferred width
PASS dynamic attributes (remove)
