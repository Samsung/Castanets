This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS lspace/voffset shifts don't affect mpadded preferred width
PASS lspace/voffset shifts don't affect mpadded size
FAIL content is shifted by the specified lspace/voffset assert_approx_equals: positive lspace expected 5 +/- 1 but got 0
FAIL content is shifted by the specified lspace/voffset (RTL) assert_approx_equals: positive lspace expected -5 +/- 1 but got 0
FAIL dynamic changes of lspace/voffset assert_approx_equals: attach lspace expected 5 +/- 1 but got 0
Harness: the test ran to completion.
