This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Keyframes set using setKeyframes() are reflected in computed style for a running transition
PASS A transition with replaced keyframes still returns the original transitionProperty
PASS A transition with no keyframes still returns the original transitionProperty
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating the same property still exhibits normal reversing behavior. Cannot read property 'effect' of undefined
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating a different property still exhibits normal reversing behavior  (reversing from the base value). Cannot read property 'effect' of undefined
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating nothing still exhibits normal reversing behavior (reversing from the base value). Cannot read property 'effect' of undefined
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes animating nothing on a property being controlled by another modified transition exhibits normal reversing behavior and reverses from the other transition's current value. Cannot read property 'transitionProperty' of undefined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
